# Bug-Finding Quiz

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter notebook and some supporting files for creating a dataframe of the English translation of Pausanias' _Description of Greece_, using data from the Perseus XML.

Your assignment is to follow along in the notebook and, where indicated, find and fix the bugs that you encounter. For each bug fixed, please add a short explanation of

1. what the bug was (i.e., what was going wrong and why) and
2. how you fixed it

Have fun, and good luck!
